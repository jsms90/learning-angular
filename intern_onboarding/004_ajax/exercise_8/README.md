# Angular 2 - Exercise 8 - Free Play

Duration: 60 minutes


## Challenge

You should have an API that you make yesterday and this morning. The challenge here is to build a front end on it.

* Write a service that can connect to your API (note, you may need to implement CORS on the API)
* Write a component that pulls from your API, and renders it.

## Ultra challenge

You should have an endpoint to add a post. Write a method in your service that will receive an object, and post it up to the service. Very nice.

Wire it up to a form. For bonus points, make it so that the form is not always visible, it appears when you click a button, then goes away again. Well hooray, that's Angular!




## Notes to Instructor

You will need to explain AJAX, CORS and JSONP
