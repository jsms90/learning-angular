# Let's learn about Angular 2!

Angular 2 is a component orientated front-end framework from Google. It's very similar to React, in fact, if you can use React you'll probably feel right at home.

* It's all about the components.
* It has a nice generator tool to make development fast.
* It uses TypeScript, which is great for larger teams.
* It's very similar to React and Vue, so your skills are transferable.

## How we use Angular 2

We currently use it for the Beamery website (http://beamery.com). We may at some future point use if for some features of the Bathtub.

In the website, we pair Angular 2 with NGRX (Reactive Extensions for Angular). This gives us a nice, scalable Flux architecture, similar to React.

More on Flux this afternoon.

## Anything can happen in the next three hours

Well actually, in the next three hours, we're going to learn the fundamentals of Angular 2. You will be able to:

* Create a simple app
* Create components
* Create Templates
* Do DOM scripting
* Use SASS (SCSS)
* Pass data around the app

Woot!
