# Let's learn about unit testing with Jasmine!

Jasmine is a behavior-driven development framework for testing JavaScript code.

* It does not depend on any other JavaScript frameworks.
* It does not require a DOM.
* It has a clean, obvious syntax so that you can easily write tests.

We're aiming to start having a test driven approach at Beamery.

We're going to learn the basics of unit testing with Jasmine. You will be able to:

* Create simple tests
* Learn about suites and specs
* Learn about matchers
* Learn about spies
