# Let's learn about Angular 2!

Angular 2 is a component orientated front-end framework from Google.

* It's all about the components.
* It has a nice generator tool to make development fast.
* It uses TypeScript, which is great for larger teams.
* It's very similar to React and Vue, so your skills are transferable.

We use it for the Beamery website.
